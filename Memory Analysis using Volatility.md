# Memory Analysis using Volatility

## Introduction  

This repository provides an in-depth forensic analysis of memory dumps using the **Volatility Framework**. The focus is on investigating the **WannaCry ransomware** attack through memory forensics techniques. By leveraging **Volatility 2.6.1**, we extract artifacts, detect persistence mechanisms, analyze registry keys, track network activity, and identify **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** from an infected systemâ€™s memory dump.  

Memory forensics is a crucial technique in **cybersecurity and incident response**, allowing investigators to recover **process lists, network connections, loaded DLLs, encryption traces, and malware artifacts** from volatile memory. This project documents the step-by-step analysis used to uncover **malicious activities** and **persistent mechanisms** related to the WannaCry ransomware.
